##  Diabetes Prediction Model
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using logistic regression and support vector machine (SVM) models.

## Features
The model considers various features for predicting diabetes risk, including:

Glucose levels
Blood pressure
Body mass index (BMI)
Insulin levels
Age
Pregnancy status (for females)

## DataSet
The dataset used for training and testing the models is sourced from Kaggle.

## Models
## Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. In this project, logistic regression is employed to predict the probability of an individual having diabetes based on the provided features.

## Support Vector Machine (SVM)
SVM is a powerful supervised learning algorithm capable of performing classification, regression, and outlier detection tasks. Here, SVM is applied to classify individuals into diabetic and non-diabetic categories based on the feature set.

## Results
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, and F1-score. Detailed results and model performance analysis can be found in the code.
